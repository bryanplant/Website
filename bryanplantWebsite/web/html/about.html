        <p class="info">Hi! My name is Bryan Plant and I am a junior Computer Science major at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT.  I've
                        lived in Montana my whole life and love the outdoors as a result.  I enjoy hiking, camping, playing soccer, and snowboarding
                        in the winter.  I also like to play guitar, video games and traveling internationally whenever I have the opportunity.  </p>
        <p class="info">I especially have a passion for all things computer related.  Since before high school I've experimented with coding with
                        everything from TI calculators to Lego Mindstorms and Arduino micro controllers.  I am always coming up with new ideas
                        for what I want to do with code, like this website for example.  The animation of this website is coded with Dart which I
                        had never used before and uses a simple genetic algorithm which is also new to me.  This and all of my other personal projects
                        can be found at my <a class='pLink' href='https://github.com/bryanplant' target="_blank">Github</a></p>
        <p class="info">While I enjoy my classes and working on personal projects I am most interested in obtaining real world experience outside of
                        the classroom.  I think that working on real world problems forces a new style of learning and I am always willing to learn
                        and adapt to new situations.  Thanks for checking out my website!</p>
